# CPSC 210 Project: Demon Defender Game
#### Sean Tang (Snake z7q8w)


### *Project Rundown*

So what exactly is this project? This is a **top down shooter game**, with the theme of a *Devilish creatures*
where traditionally, one would **survive for as long as possible**. In this game, you start off in a room/rooms where
you must attempt to **survive constant waves of devilish creatures**, until you die. You're able to defend yourself with **guns**, 
and you're able to **upgrade** them, **purchase new weapons**, and even **get abilities**. The longer you last, the 
higher the score. *Are you able to defend yourself against waves of demons and devlish creatures?*?

### *Who Would Use This?*

Great question. Who would play this game? Here's a list of possible users:
		
- My fellow game dev friends
- Fellow university students (not during class of course)
- Anyone looking for a quick, fun game
- survival game fans

### *Personal Interest*

The reason for picking this project is because of my personal interest in making games. I've always loved
playing video games, and so I've always wanted to try my hand at them. I wanted to create a simple and short game
that someone can enjoy at whichever time you want; I often find myself with 5 minutes before a class, not knowing 
what to do. Maybe this game can help fill those times, and would also be something cool to show people in the 
future!
